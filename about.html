                <h1>Hi! I'm Binh</h1>
                <p>A Junior Developer with a passion for building clean, efficient, and user-friendly applications. 
                    I enjoy working with Javascript, Java, SQL, along with frameworks and libraries that go with them. 
                    Also, I have an interest in game development, especially using ROBLOX studio with Roblox Lua. 
                    Right now, I'm constantly learning new things to improve my skill.</p>
                <p>When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me playing ROBLOX, exploring new knowledges, or chatting with my friends.
                    I'm always open to have new friends, have challenges and oppoturnities to develop myself, so feel free to connect with me!
                </p>
